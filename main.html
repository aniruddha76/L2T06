      <h1>GAMING AS A HOBBY</h1>
      <div class="meta">
        I have been gaming for as long as I can remember, and it is a hobby that is shared by an estimated 3.1 billion people worldwide.
In this page I share why gaming is special to me and will always be.

  <p>What makes gaming so special...
    I could answer simply that it is entertaining, games are entertainment, therefore I am entertained. but it is much deeper than that. There are two parts to this answer.
    The first part is regarding single player games such as The Witcher 3. Games like these have massive, detailed and sprawling worlds that you can get completely lost in for hours at a time. Not only are the worlds incredible but so are the stories, characters, music, combat and many other things about it. These all work together to make a truly immersive and amazing experience that no other form of entertainment can. There are countless different single player games to experience and a truly massive variety of genres, from fantasy roleplaying games to horror to realistic sim racing.
    
    The second part is regarding multiplayer games. There is nothing like playing a game with friends online or local co-op.
    Multiplayer games allow you to not only have a great time with friends or family, but also meet some awesome new people too. I have met so many great people from all over the world that I not only play games with, but talk to regularly outside of gaming too. Gaming is a way to connect with people that you otherwise may have never even met in the first place, and to me that is something quite special.
    
    Gaming is such a massively diverse hobby, so there really is something for everyone to enjoy.</p>

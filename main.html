        <h1>Gaming as a Hobby: Power Up Your Fun</h1>
        <p>
          I have been gaming for as long as I can remember, and it is a hobby
          that is shared by an estimated 3.1 billion people worldwide. <br />In
          this page I share why gaming is special to me and will always be.

        <h2>What makes gaming so special...</h2>
        <p>
          I could answer simply that it is entertaining, games are
          entertainment, therefore I am entertained. but it is much deeper than
          that. There are two parts to this answer.<br />The first part is
          regarding single player games such as The Witcher 3. Games like these
          have massive, detailed and sprawling worlds that you can get
          completely lost in for hours at a time. Not only are the worlds
          incredible but so are the stories, characters, music, combat and many
          other things about it. These all work together to make a truly
          immersive and amazing experience that no other form of entertainment
          can. There are countless different single player games to experience
          and a truly massive variety of genres, from fantasy roleplaying games
          to horror to realistic sim racing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second part is regarding multiplayer games. There is nothing like
          playing a game with friends online or local co-op.<br />
          Multiplayer games allow you to not only have a great time with friends
          or family, but also meet some awesome new people too. I have met so
          many great people from all over the world that I not only play games
          with, but talk to regularly outside of gaming too. Gaming is a way to
          connect with people that you otherwise may have never even met in the
          first place, and to me that is something quite special.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gaming is such a massively diverse hobby, so there really is something
          for everyone to enjoy.

            <b>1. Elden ring</b><br />
            Elden Ring is an open world action role-playing game developed by
            FromSoftware, who are masters at their craft and have created an
            entire genre of games. This game is the culmination of everything
            they have learnt from their previous titles and has seen success
            beyond belief. Elden Ring is everything I have ever wanted in an
            open world game. This is first and foremost due to its gameplay and
            world building. You can truly get lost in this massive diverse open
            world, and right from the start you are free to explore wherever you
            lay your eyes. The gameplay is punishing and challenging, so when
            you overcome a tough enemy it is a rewarding experience that not
            many other games can match. The art design is truly a marvel to
            behold and at times I found myself just walking slowly or riding my
            spectral steed staring at the glorious views. It is like you are
            exploring a painting. The lore and story is extremely well thought
            out too, and it is not delivered like it is in most games. In Elden
            Ring (as well as FromSoftware's precious titles) a bit part of the
            story is told through environmental storytelling and through item
            descriptions which you can read in-game. This gives a sense of
            mystery and urges the player to figure things out for themselves and
            leaving some things up for interpretation. To me this is the perfect
            game.<br />

            <b>2. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</b><br />
            The Witcher 3 is a massive open world adventure game that you can
            get lost in for hundreds of hours. In this game you take the role of
            Geralt of Rivia, a witcher, one of the last monster slayers for
            hire. The story will keep you wanting to know what happens next, and
            you also have the freedom of making choices that will shape your
            journey and the fate of others, for netter or for good, it is up to
            you to decide. The game features a vast and visually stunning open
            world that feels alive and filled to the brim with detail. You will
            explore diverse landscapes, from lush forests to war-torn villages,
            and even entirely different continents, each with its own unique
            atmosphere. There is also a card game in the game called Gwent,
            which you could get lost in for hours too, and going all over the
            regions in the game challenging other players and collecting cards
            to strengthen your deck. This game is packed with so many quests and
            things to do that you may never even do all there is to do, and each
            playthrough you will still find new things and make different
            choices resulting in an almost new experience.<br />

            <b>3. Monster Hunter World</b><br />
            Monster Hunter is a very special series to me. It is difficult to
            choose which one is best, but Monster Hunter World would have to be
            it. In this game, though the story may be decent, it is all about
            hunting monsters, carving their materials once you slay them, and
            then crafting better weapons and armor back at your home base. Then
            you go out once again and hunt even tougher monsters, and craft even
            better gear. This is the core gameplay loop in Monster Hunter games,
            and before you know it you have a thousand or more hours in the
            game. You get a true feeling of being a monster hunter, having to
            prepare for hunts before departing on the hunt, such as crafting
            items like healing potions and monster traps, and eating at the
            canteen which gives you special bonus stats depending on what meal
            you pick on the menu. If you want a game with near unlimited replay
            value, Monster Hunter might be the game for you.<br />
